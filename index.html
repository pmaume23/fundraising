      <h2>Fundraising Goals</h2>
      <p class = "donation-message" >Hi everyone, I am currently fundraising money to help me attend university in Japan. I have been recently accepted to study an MBA program at Kwansei Gakuin
        University. However, due to covid I am not currently able to travel to Japan so I am currently looking for funds to help me extend my visa extension (OPT) so
        that I can attend online classes while in the United states.The money received from this campaign will help me to find a place to stay, cover my food, medical
        insurance as well as visa extension application. As an international student, I am not allowed to work until i get an OPT approval therefore, I am not able to
        raise money. I will also use the money for my housing in Japan and visa application as soon as foreigners are allowed entry into Japan. I will forever be
        grateful to everyone who donates to this cause and your contributions will allow me to start a new journeyÂ </p>
